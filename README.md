# ScheduleScan
Given a list of classes, will scrape data and find remaining seats


TO GET LINKS FOR CLASSES
-------------------------
1. BSU Home Page -> Self Service Banner -> Student -> Course Catalog -> Search Availiable Class Offerings -> Find your class and grab the URL

NOTE: Make sure you select the right course (double check the course number), it's very easy to select the wrong class

2. Once a URL is grabbed, replace the keys with your class name (or whatever works best, this part isn't picky) and 
insert your link as the value.
